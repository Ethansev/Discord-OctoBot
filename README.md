# OctoBot

Discord bot for my personal server. Basic implementation but I'll continue to add to it.

## Features

- Adds -poo to the end of new user's name. (The server theme is toilet paper)
- Responds to certain emojis with another emoji.
- Tells a your momma joke anytime the word 'mom' (and other iterations) appears.
- Slash commands for ChatGPT
- <s>Kicks Joel out of the server whenever he types in chat. </s>

## Future Plans

- [x] Refactor to Typescript
- [ ] Add music functionality for voice chat (spotify, youtube, soundcloud)
- [ ] Add twitch stream announcement for Sid
- [ ] Give bot a dick~ish personality and have it respond to users
- [ ] Containerize in a docker container

## Patch Notes

### v1.0 - July 7, 2023
- Refactored to Typescript and restructured logic. No feature additions, minor optimizations.
