# OctoBot

Discord bot for my personal server. Basic implementation, but I'll implement restful api structure for more features.

## What It Does

- Adds -poo to the end of new user's name. (The theme of the server is toilet paper)
- Responds to certain emojis with another emoji.
- Tells a your momma joke anytime the word mom (and other iterations) are typed.
- Added slash commands for ChatGPT (new)
- <s>Kicks Joel out of the server whenever he types in chat. </s>

## Future Plans

- [ ] Add extra api functionalities
- [ ] Add twitch stream announcement for Sid
