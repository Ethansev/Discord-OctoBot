# OctoBot
 Discord bot for my personal server. Basic implementation, but I'll implement restful api structure for more features.  

### What It Does
 - Adds -poo to the end of new user's name. (The theme of the server is toilet paper)
 - Responds to certain emojis with another emoji. 
 - Tells a your momma joke anytime the word mom (and other iterations) are typed. 

### Future Plans
- [ ] Add extra api functionalities
- [ ] Add slash commands
- [ ] Add twitch stream announcement for Sid
- [ ] Add Dall-E commands (I just got access)
